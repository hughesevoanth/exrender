# An R package to test rendering a pdf
## NOTE: *this package is strictly for testing !*

### Authors: David Hughes 
##### Date started: Oct 8th 2021

### About:

This repo contains a few functions to test the rendering of a pdf with an embeded png|jpg and a few figures. Some colleagues experience issues with rendering the metaboprep pdf report because of some tinytex and pandoc issues. So I am going to try and seperate the running of metaboprep and the rendering of a pdf report to recreate errors, identify errors and find solutions. 

### Installation

	devtools::install_github("hughesevoanth/exrender")

## pdflatex is required to generate the pdf outside the RStudio IDE

To have the pdf report generated - in a terminal or HPC - you must have a latex to pdf engine installed. To check if it already available on your system run:

	Sys.which('pdflatex')

To determine which version you have run:

	pdflatex -v
	
This is a pdf engine from pdfTeX (https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) written by Han The Thanh. It is distributed in TeX Live (https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and MacTex (https://www.tug.org/mactex/) or MiKTeX (https://miktex.org). If you find that pdflatex is not available on your system do install it via one of the referenced links.
