### About:

This repo contains a few functions to test the rendering of a pdf with an embeded png|jpg and a few figures. Some colleagues experience issues with rendering the metaboprep pdf report because of some tinytex and pandoc issues. So I am going to try and seperate the running of metaboprep and the rendering of a pdf report to recreate errors, identify errors and find solutions.
